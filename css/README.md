# Project concept.

* This is my 2nd project with Code Louisville for Javascript class 2020.
* Project is basically a (To Do List) which means you can type any task you want to do and once it's taken care of you can simply click x to remove it from your to do list of items.

* If your task requires travelling either by ground or air you can click on the Quick Weather Forecast button to give you the latest update on weather update for specific city.

* If you have any question about this project please contact me by email at naseem_orfany18@hotmail.com.
